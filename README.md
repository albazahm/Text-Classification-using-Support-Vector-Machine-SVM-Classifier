# Text-Classification-using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-Classifier

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have a wide array of applications. One of these applications is on text data, where due to the large feature space that is generated by embedding techniques on the predictor features, it is has a better time finding a hyperplane of separation between classes in a classification problem.

This assignment for the Lantern Institute will explore the implementation of Support Vector Machine on text classification. It will include preprocessing/cleaning of the text features, followed by embedding of the features, fittng the SVM model, visualizing feature importances, as well as pipeline construction and model optimization.
